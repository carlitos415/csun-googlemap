# Csun Map Game With Google Maps Api

this will use Google Maps API to center the location over CSUN. once that is set the map will not display any Points of Interest on the map or any Street names. 
The user should not be able to move the map around so most of the features are disabled. it will ask you for locations and then ask the user to double click on the map where they 
think the location is. If wrong then the map will highlight the correct are in red. If right the map will highlight the correct are in greeen.
A the end of the game the user will see how many location they got correct of the 5 locations that are precoded into the website.
